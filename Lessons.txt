- On opening files - 

when you have to open files in python make sure to copy the path and add a r before the citation marks with the file name 
this makes it possible to open the path as it is and not make any mistakes when reading the file name


- on printing from file by using a loop -

for line in filename:
    matrix.append(line)

filename.close()

print(matrix)
